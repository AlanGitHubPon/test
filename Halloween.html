<p><i>Roblox 2007 halloween event</i></p>
<p class="bg-color">Halloween Treasure Hunt was a Roblox event held during Halloween 2007. The event was exclusive to Builders Club members only, as ownership of the Halloween Lorebook One, then marked Builders Club-only, was required to participate. Users in the event had a chance to earn The Crimson Catseye hat if they located the 12 lorebooks scattered around the map.</p>
<p>The event took place on a modified version of the Haunted Hill level, which was built by Shedletsky in 2006.
Due to the short and secretive nature of this event, the blog post about it was published after it had ended rather than when it began.
Though The Crimson Catseye was the prize for this event, at the time it could also be purchased in the catalog for 50,000 Tickets.
The account used to host the event, HauntedHill, has since been terminated. The reason for this is currently unknown.
HauntedHill's level in which the event took place has also been moderated, rendering it inaccessible and making it difficult to find information about the event.</p>
