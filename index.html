           <p>This page about some ROBLOX Events</p>
        <p>An event is an officially created limited-time challenge that usually involves different objectives and has different limited-time rewards that cannot be obtained after the event ends.
             (Unless the item becomes limited, such as the Riptide, which rarely happens.) Roblox events are commonly sponsored events where new movies or brands, have limited-time events associated or themed with their product.</p>

<p>They were replaced with Developer Events on May 13, 2019.
 Events were brought back on Roblox again for the Egg Hunt 2020 as of January 11, 2020 according to a Roblox tweet about the Egg Hunt 2020: Agents of E.G.G..</p>
