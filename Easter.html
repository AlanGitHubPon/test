        Roblox Easter Egg Hunt 2012 was the third egg hunt on Roblox, which started on April 6, 2012, and ended on April 17, 2012.
         A place was specifically made for the eggs to drop in. When collected, the eggs would go into your inventory, and you would also receive a badge. There were a total of 25 eggs, with one of them being in a separate game. Items, such as the Egg Cannon 9000, were designed to help you find all of the eggs. The egg hunt lasted for eleven days. The event shattered a record of how many players were playing one game at one time, with 9,354 being the record. This record was later topped at 2013's Egg Hunt,
         which attracted approximately 20,000 players to the game at one time.

        2013 ROBLOX Easter Egg Hunt was the fourth annual egg hunt on Roblox. The place was made by the user Games, and the event ran from March 26, 2013 to April 5, 2013.

Previously, there were egg drops held in 2008, 2010, and an egg hunt in 2012, which makes the 2013 Egg Hunt the first ROBLOX Easter Egg activity in an odd-numbered year. Although most of the egg hunting took place in one game, a few eggs were hidden in a few unspecified places on Roblox. At the egg hunt, players had to hunt for eggs in an all-terrain map. The players then received a badge when an egg was found. Also, the egg corresponding to the badge was also obtained. Some of the eggs hatched and unveiled exclusive items for players with the eggs.
 Several different items were released in the avatar shop in order to assist players with the egg hunt.

        Eggstravaganza, also known as Egg Hunt 2008, was the first Egg hunt event that began on March 20, 2008, and ended on March 23, 2008. The event lasted for one hour at starting 11am PST for the first two days and lasted for four hours also starting at 11am PST on the final day.

Following its release, players figured out how to take advantage of the egg dropping system by creating egg funnels, which would allow players to quickly collect all the eggs.
