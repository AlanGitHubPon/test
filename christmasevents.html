    Giftsplosion 2012 was the Christmas gift giving event of 2012. Over the course of nine days, the Roblox administrators released nine gift boxes into the avatar shop.
     Gifts were rewarded to those who met the requirements hidden within the riddles provided. Once an obtaining period has ended, the gift box was put on sale with a timer for a set amount of Robux based around the difficulty of the requirement. After the gift box went off sale, it opened and granted the owners a new item in their inventory.

This giftsplosion involved the use of features which were introduced in 2012.
 Some examples would be using The Trade System, selling gamepasses and gear at one's place, and having a video thumbnail image in a gameslot.
 The Best reward was The Coolest Gift

    Giftsplosion 2013 was the Christmas gift giving event of 2013. Over the course of 13 days, the Roblox administrators released 13 gift boxes into the avatar shop.
 Gifts were rewarded to those who met the requirements hidden within the riddles provided. Once an obtaining period has ended, the gift box was put on sale with a timer for a set amount of Robux based around the difficulty of the requirement. After the gift box went off sale, it opened and granted the owners a new item in their inventory.

    This giftsplosion utilized new features such as outfits, user-uploaded sounds, paid access and the developer exchange.
     It was also the first to incorporate the participation of another major event (BLOXtober 2013) as one of the requirements.
